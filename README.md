# ARFaceGeometry vertices map with numbers
This app shows the index for each location in ARFaceGeometry vertices array. 

I searched the Internet to find something like this, but could not find anything, so I made this. The numbers can be hard to read, you can adjust the numbers size and remove the lines.
